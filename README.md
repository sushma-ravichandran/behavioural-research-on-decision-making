## Behavioral Research on Decision-Making: Project Summary

### üìä Project Overview  
This project is based on my M.Sc. dissertation, a behavioral study examining the factors that influence ethical decision-making in conflict scenarios. It showcases my expertise in **experimental design, primary data collection, and advanced inferential analysis**, and highlights my ability to move from a theoretical research question to a **data-driven conclusion**. The project also demonstrates how I integrate **behavioral science principles with data analytics**, bridging human decision-making and practical business strategy through a full-cycle analytical approach.

### üìå Research Question  
How do authority structures and personal characteristics influence compliance in ethical decision-making scenarios?

### üõ†Ô∏è Methods & Tools  
- **Data Collection**: Used **Qualtrics** to create and distribute online surveys to **60 participants**, ensuring data integrity and structured responses.
- **Ethical Compliance**: Developed a **detailed participant consent form** and submitted an **Ethical Review Application Form**, ensuring participant rights, anonymity, and compliance with research ethics standards.    
- **Experimental Design**: Two-factor (authority √ó peer influence), with gender as an additional variable.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employed **SPSS** to perform rigorous inferential analysis, including two-way and three-way **ANOVA**, to test hypotheses and identify significant interaction effects.

### üîë Key Findings  
- The analysis revealed significant patterns in compliance behavior related to specific demographic factors, providing insights into the nuances of authority-driven decision-making.
- The focus of the project was on the **methodological rigor** and statistical testing applied to uncover these patterns.    
- Academic behavioral insights were translated into implications for **organizational compliance and HR analytics**.

### üß© Skills Demonstrated  
- **Experimental Design & Research Methodology**: Proficiency in translating abstract behavioral concepts into structured, testable frameworks and designing reliable experiments from hypothesis to data collection.
- **Data Collection**: Expertise in using professional survey tools like Qualtrics for primary data acquisition. 
- **Inferential Statistics**: Advanced knowledge of statistical tests, including ANOVA and related tests to evaluate complex behavioral interactions.  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Proficient in SPSS for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and insight reporting.  
- **Academic Writing & Communication**: The skill to present complex research findings in a clear and structured manner for academic and professional audiences.
 
### üéØ Relevance for Data Analytics  
- Demonstrates a solid foundation in **scientific inquiry and statistical reasoning**, complementing applied machine learning and dashboarding projects.  
- Showcases capability to design and execute projects **from scratch**: hypothesis ‚Üí experimental design ‚Üí ethics approval ‚Üí participant data collection ‚Üí statistical testing ‚Üí interpretation.
- This work serves as a robust example of my direct transferability to real-world business challenges such as **A/B testing, user research, and strategic decision-making**. It shows that I can deliver a comprehensive, ethically sound, and statistically rigorous research, a critical skill for any modern analytics team.
